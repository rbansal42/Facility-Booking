# Facility-Booking

This is a project that I and my partner @Staphin are working on as part of our Web Development Course.
We aim to use a MEAN stack for this, and build a portal that is as convenient to admins as it is to users. With Beautiful UI all around, the goal is to make managing facilities to this portal a desire, and not an additional task.

# Future Releases {# Future-Releases}
While we're still in the stages of creating a front-end, we are already expanding our vision for the project.
Further releases will support features such as:
- Google OAuth 2.0 for in-domain verification
- Printing
- Site-wide command search
  - Book facility
  - Confirm Facilities (For admins)
  - Update booking
  - View Facility Calendar
- OTP Verification to confirm booking
- Request Prioritisation
